# Matrix_Multiplication_Number_Theoretic_Transform
Matrix Multiplication using Number Theoretic Transform in different languages

# Python

Prerequisite:
Sage

Also, use Schoolbook multiplication to verify the result.

# C++

Use Montgomery reduction to accelerate.
simply type "make" to compile and run.

# Neon Intrinsics

Based on Arm v8a, please make sure the compile does support neon intrinsics before compiling the program.
Use Montgomery reduction to speed up.
simple type "make" to compile and run.
